# Block Game Proof of Concept

This is the prototype for a game made by Daniel Hamill in March 2017 using LWJGL
(light weight java game library) and Java.

The game can be played by running BlockGame.jar

The purpose of this project was to practice a few things:
- Making a game almost from scratch
- Creating custom animations and graphics
- Different enemies with unique patterns and difficult 'boss' variants

### Tutorial Levels

The game only currently has the tutorial which introduces game mechanics to the
player as they play each level, requiring them to learn the mechanics (like slowing
down or dashing) before they can advance to the main game.
